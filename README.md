Creating Deep Dream AI with Caffe

Deep Dreams (with Caffe)

Credits: Forked from DeepDream by Google

This notebook demonstrates how to use the Caffe neural network framework to produce "dream" visuals shown in the Google Research blog post.

It'll be interesting to see what imagery people are able to generate using the described technique. If you post images to Google+, Facebook, or Twitter, be sure to tag them with #deepdream so other researchers can check them out too.

##Dependencies This notebook is designed to have as few dependencies as possible:

Standard Python scientific stack: NumPy, SciPy, PIL, IPython. Those libraries can also be installed as a part of one of the scientific packages for Python, such as Anaconda or Canopy.
Caffe deep learning framework (installation instructions).
Google protobuf library that is used for Caffe model manipulation.
